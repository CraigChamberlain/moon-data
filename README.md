[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/CraigChamberlain/moon-data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/CraigChamberlain/moondata)


Based on data taken from the [The United States Naval Observatory (USNO) api](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/api.php#phase) before it was taken down for maintenance.  Reuse is with permission of USNO but they have not checked my work for errors and can not be held responsible for any errors hereinafter.
[Example of original response](/USNO/ExampleYear.json)

## UTC
All times are UTC as the moon appears in the same phase for all locations on the planet.  Adjust for local time as required.

## Endpoints 
  - moon-phase-data _/api/moon-phase-data/{year}[/index.json]_
  - new-moon-data _/api/new-moon-data/{year}[/index.json]_
  - lunar-solar-calendar _/api/lunar-solar-calendar/{year}[/index.json]_

Data can be served at {year} directory or optionally at {year}/index.json.  Adding the index.json will negate a 301 redirect to increase the speed of request and may be required if your client does not support redirects.
